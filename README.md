# iVProg
Interactive Visual Programming on the Internet by [LInE](https://usp.br/line)
The current version of iVProg is implemented under HTML stack (we had other versions in Java).
The iVProg is directed to introduce algorithms and programming, by adopting a visual programing paradigm, but also presents the corresponding code in a traditional way (textual). It also implement a model to automatic evaluate programming exercices (by test-cases).
Besides, iVProg  can be integrated to Moodle by the use o iAssign package (https://github.com/LInE-IME-USP/iAssign).
